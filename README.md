# AI in Neural Engineering Workshop Demo
Welcome to the **AI in Neural Engineering Workshop Demo** repository! This repo contains the example code and materials presented during the *AI in Neural Engineering* workshop. The goal of this demo is to showcase practical applications and implementations covered during the session.

This notebook covers a Python-based machine learning code to build a binary classifer that distinguish PD patients from Healthy controls (HC). It follows the workshop slides and is not intended to stand on its own. It runs only with partiall code and data from the original paper, so does not intend to replicate the result of the paper with the code provided.
