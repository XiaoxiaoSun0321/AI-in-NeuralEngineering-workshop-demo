This repo notebook covers a Python-based machine learning code to build a binary classifer that distinguish PD patients from Healthy controls (HC). It follows the workshop slides and is not intended to stand on its own. It runs only with partiall code and data from the actul paper, so does not intend to replicate the result of the paper with the following code.
